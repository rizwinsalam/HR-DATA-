**Project Description: Employee Analysis and Turnover Trends**

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to analyze various aspects of employee demographics, turnover rates, and tenure within the company. By examining gender breakdowns, employment lengths, departmental turnover rates, and net changes in employee numbers over time, we aim to gain insights into the workforce dynamics and identify areas for potential improvement.

**Scope:**
1. **Gender Breakdown Analysis:**
   - Calculate the gender distribution among employees.
   - Differentiate between headquarters and remote locations.

2. **Employee Tenure and Termination Analysis:**
   - Determine the average length of employment for terminated employees.
   - Identify trends in employee turnover rates across departments.

3. **Departmental Analysis:**
   - Analyze turnover rates across departments, highlighting areas with the highest and lowest turnover rates.
   - Evaluate the average tenure for each department.

4. **Net Change in Employee Numbers:**
   - Investigate the net change in the number of employees over recent years.

**Key Findings:**
- The gender distribution among employees is fairly balanced, but there are generally more male employees than female employees.
- The marketing department exhibits the highest turnover rate, followed by the training department.
- Departments such as Research and Development, Support, and Legal have the lowest turnover rates.
- The net change in employee numbers has varied over the years, indicating fluctuations in workforce size.
- On average, employees have a tenure of approximately 8 years, with legal and auditing departments having the highest tenure, while services, sales, and marketing departments have the lowest.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement strategies to address the high turnover rates in the marketing and training departments, such as conducting exit interviews to identify root causes and implementing retention initiatives.
- Recognize and reward long-serving employees to enhance retention and foster a culture of loyalty.
- Consider reallocating resources or restructuring departments based on turnover rates and tenure analysis to optimize workforce efficiency.

**Conclusion:**
This project provides comprehensive insights into employee demographics, turnover trends, and tenure within the company. By understanding these dynamics, the company can make informed decisions to improve employee satisfaction, retention, and overall organizational effectiveness.

This is major a data cleaning and analysis in MySQL project and can also be done in PostgreSQL.

While doing this guided project, I learned how to do data cleaning and analysis in MySQL. Learned how to convert dates, and how to use subqueries and filters in the data to get correct outputs. The query results are saved as csv files to be used later on in creating a simple PowerBI dashboard.
